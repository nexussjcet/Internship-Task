# React Persistent Task Manager

*A simple task management app built with React to practice hooks and localStorage.*

## About  
This project is a lightweight task manager I built during my BTech in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence and Data Science) to deepen my understanding of React hooks, state management, and browser storage. It helps users add, complete, and delete tasks — with data saved locally for persistence.

## Features
- Add tasks with live updates  
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete

## Why This Project?
This app was built during my internship as my first real project using React and Vite. It's part of my hands-on learning experience in modern web development. I'm exploring component-based UIs, state management, and how real apps persist data — all from the ground up.   

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rinorobert/Internship-Task.git
cd task-tracker
npm install
npm run dev
